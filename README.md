# COLLEGE-SFML-PROJECT-Square-Root
This is my first ever project, and it was made as the final requirement for my OOP classes. 

Be warned that the code is HORRIBLE, there are variables written in spanish, and others in english, the design is overall bad as well (Classes know too much about each other) and it is not very readable. 

Anyways, I'm proud of it because I was able to come to solutions for all my problems and there are a lot of hours spent on this.
