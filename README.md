# COLLEGE-SFML-PROJECT-Square-Root
This is my first ever 100% coding project, and it was made as the final requirement for my OOP classes. 

Some variables are written in spanish and others in english, it isn't meant to be readable, but you can look at the architecture of the classes.

The most interesting you can take from this code is the State system.
